Unity and lifetime managers
===

Some unit tests to demonstrate the lifetime of a class with IOC (using Microsoft Unity).

Original source: http://www.tomdupont.net/2013/12/undestanding-unity-lifetime-managers.html

The main goal of this project is just to understand how does Unity work, when Services (or Repositories) are instanciated and the particularity of some LifeTimeManagers.
